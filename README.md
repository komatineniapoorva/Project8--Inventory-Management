# Project8-Inventory-Management
I leveraged **PYTHON** to analyze the data and used **TABLEAU** for creating Dashboards and Reporting to draw actionable insights and Recommendations.

**Objective:**
The objective of the project is to develop a robust predictive model for inventory management leveraging historical sales data and inventory records. 
By analyzing these datasets, the model aims to forecast product demand accurately, enabling businesses to maintain optimized inventory levels. 
Additionally, the project includes integrating the predictive model into a Tableau dashboard to provide real-time insights for inventory management


**Dataset Description:**
The dataset comprises various columns including:
•	Order Details: Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Order Priority.
•	Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment.
•	Location Details: City, State, Country, Postal Code, Region.
•	Product Details: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name.

The initial dataset contains approximately 51,000 records and 24 columns. After data preprocessing, including handling null values and removing outliers, 
the dataset size reduced to 36,311 records and 22 columns.
